# AI Art Detector

This project is a Streamlit web application that uses a YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) model from ultralytics to classify whether an uploaded image of an art piece is AI-generated or real art.

## Overview

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
- **AI Detection**: The application uses a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model to classify the image as either AI-generated or real art.
